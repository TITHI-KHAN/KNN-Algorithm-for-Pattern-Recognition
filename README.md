# KNN Algorithm for Pattern Recognition

Step 01:
Regressor:
1. Import data set
2. Separate x(Gender, Height) and y (y=Weight)
3. Train = 70%, Test = 30%
4. Apply Linear Regression
5. Evaluate the Model (Testing and training Accuracy, MSE for testing)
6. Apply KNN Regressor: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html
7. Evaluate the Model (Testing and training Accuracy, MSE for testing)
8. Compare KNN & Linear regression with the KNN model and Linear regression as well.


Step 02:
KNN Classifier:
1. Import data set
2. Separate x and (y=Gender)
3. Train = 70%, Test = 30%
4. Apply KNN Classifier 
5. Evaluate the Model by only Accuracy.
6. Apply KNN Classifier: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html
